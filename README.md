My name is OumaÃ¯ma Bounhar. I am an Engineering student at the **Polytechnic Institute of Paris**, currently in a **Master 2** program where I study **AI, Telecomunications and Security**.

I enjoy working on challenging tasks and I thrive in environments that push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.
I find the ability of AI to learn and adapt fascinating, and I am enthusiastic about contributing to the development of intelligent systems that can make a positive impact on various industries.
